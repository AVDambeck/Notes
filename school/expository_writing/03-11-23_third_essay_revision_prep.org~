#+TITLE: Third Essay Revision Prep

* Trying Something New!
I learned a lot about org mode, and am trying to integrate it into my essay process. Firstly I'm just doing my prep work in an org doc. Second, and the real reason I want to, is to organize my ideas in a broken down orgy way. :)

** DONE Make prep document.
