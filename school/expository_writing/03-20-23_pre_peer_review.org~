Dear Khushi Bajaj,

My drafting process for the AE3 was marked by being fairly rushed and formulaic. I considered the prompt very briefly, then jumped into outlining the structure of my essay and then filling out that structure. I conceptualized my essay as a pyramid, and tried to make each idea connect to the ones above it. This structure was more nebulous than previously, which I felt helped me adapt ideas more fluidly, but I think I am overall reaching the limit of the formulaic process. I'm satisfied with the draft, but it is most definitely a draft, often with some intuitive logic, and a very large amount of generalization and summarizing. These latter two problems are major areas of focus for my revision.
