* Introduciton.
My first draft was really strong. I dont really need to redraft the whole thing like I have in previous drafts. I'm 30 words short of the new word count. Theres a few spots where I have a handful of extra words, and I think I can make paragraph one a bit shorter in the end. Basically my plan is to get out one more quick body paragraph and then make my other ones a bit shorter. I'll need to jump back into my sources to get some fresh takes tho.
