Dear Khushi Bajaj,

I think the high level concept connecting the two authors, that of the connection between a loving relationship, and happiness, is one of the strongest parts of your essay. I think this can be a very strong angle, as it incorporates elements discussed by both authors, while still leaving room for your own thought, analysis and ideas. Additionally, there are some very strong passages, where your thoughs are very clean and sequiturial.

Additionally, I think that your revision process is a great strength. Going back to the readings and so thoroughly studying them is a great process. It  shows strong academic skills, and is a good sign for your writing in general. Based on the letter you wrote to me and our discussion in class today, I suspect you already have a fairly strong grip on your draft, and what can be improved going forward.

I have two major points of improvement. The first thing I want to talk about is the structure of the essay. It has only two body paragraphs, the same as your first draft. This is a major error, which isn't corrected. Overall though, the flow of this draft is not the cleanest. I find it has difficulty connecting ideas strongly. I often found myself struggling to understand the ordering or connection between the ideas presented. In several places the topic of a paragraph, changes abruptly to a seemingly unconnected topic. This is an issue I also faced, and what i found worked for me was redrafting my essay, i.e. from a blank document rewriting my essay completely. That doesn't mean abandoning the ideas I had, merely restating them in a more clear and connected way. Also look out for sentences where you start and end with the same thought, i.e. circular logic.

The second major critique is summarization. A lot of your essay is made from summarizing ideas already expressed in the sources. That is to say there are sections where you simple repeat what Fredrickson or Gilbert have already said. Keep in mind that you are writing for an informed reader. Part of this issue arises when summarizing after quotations; you go on for a very long time restating the quote with out breaking it down or analyzing. Your writing could be made stronger by being more direct and brief in your summarization, and then spending more time logically connection your own ideas.

I also have a few brief questions about specifics I didn't gleam from your essay directly. Incorporate these into your essay could make your argument more well rounded. What exactly are positivity and negativity? What is the significance of satisfaction? What is the significance of confidence and how does it relate to satisfaction, happiness, and positivity?

As a last thought, there is a mistake I noticed with your works sited: make sure that it is properly indented. If one citation goes more than one line, the second line should not be indented, i.e. the line starting with "everything" should be against the page margin. 

Looking at you're first body paragraph and comparing it to the body paragraph template, I see that you clearly state your topic, and quickly get into the quotation. However you spend three or four sentences summarizing Gilbert before introducing your own thoughts. You introduce satisfaction, which I think is interesting, but not explored enough. For your connecting thought, I think you start to generalize again. After your second quote, you also spend a lot of time summarizing Fredrickson's ideas without introducing your own.

Overall, with the right time and effort, I'm confident you'll write a great third draft. 

Sincerely,
Kitkat Dambeck
