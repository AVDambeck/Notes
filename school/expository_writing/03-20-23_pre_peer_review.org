Dear Khushi Bajaj,

My drafting process for the AE3 was marked by being fairly rushed and formulaic. I considered the prompt very briefly, however I quickly moved on due to time pressure. I jumped into outlining the structure of my essay and then filling out that structure. I conceptualized my essay as a pyramid, and tried to make each idea connect to the ones above it. This structure was more nebulous when compared to the ones used in previously essays. I felt that this helped me adapt ideas more fluidly. Perviously I had used a very doggish fill-in-the-blank process. Overall, I think I am overall reaching the limit of this kind of formulaic process. In this draft, I generalized very extensive. I often found myself generalizing to fill in or connect blanks. In high school my process was much more stream of thought, which I hope to incorporate elements of in the future. I'm satisfied with the draft, but it is most definitely a draft, often with some unintuitive logic, and a very large amount of generalization and summarizing. These latter two problems are major areas of focus for my revision.

My revision process is going slower than expected and desired. Firstly I find myself pressed for time. I'm also struggling with mindset issues that are making it difficult to write. These issues are no doubt intertwined. I am brainstorming strategies to address both the time management and mindset issues. I'm reviewing my draft, and finding it much less coherent than I remember, which is both disheartening, and a significant amount of work to correct. However this is a also a sign that there is significant room for improvement. For my second draft, I want to:
1. Reduce the amount of generalization.
2. Connect ideas more closely, particularly between the two authors.
3. Have a greater number of more concise paragraphs.
  
I am particularly happy that this essay is challenging me on a process level. I am finding the writing I produce through this more fluid process to be overall of higher quality. However there are yet further challenges stemming from this. Specifically,the process is both more tiring and more time consuming. When my AE3 is finally finished, I expect it to have a higher strength of ideas, clarity, and overall persuasiveness than previous essays. 

My biggest challenge while revising this is a lack of time. Both during the initial drafting, and during the revision, I find myself rushing, and then being frustrated at my subpar performance due to said rushing. I find this has been a pattern with my essays, but this time I find it both particularly powerful both in terms of its magnitude and effect. Additionally, visual art students at Mason Gross are on an alternate schedule this week, and so my typical working times are disrupted. 

In past revisions, my process has mostly been that of re-outlining the essay, changing ideas that don't flow, and addressing specific errors. For AE3, I am restating ideas from the draft, keeping the new draft next to the old one. This process is much more like writing a new essay from scratch, than modifying an existing essay. I am trying to express my ideas thoroughly and efficiently. I am also employing free writes, to try and capture more ideas that address the prompt, and that connect to each other. I'm still very happy that I have one further draft beyond this one. Id est, I am anticipating the time crunch keeping this essay back from its maximum potential. 

Sincerely,
Paper Dragon General Baroness Kitkat Dambeck, Ruler of the Four Corners of their Bedroom and Sewer of one thousand words.
