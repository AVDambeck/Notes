You want to find artists that relate to the theme, not the topic. "tree" not "forest". Searching tree doesnt get you climate change or enviornment or arborism, and a lot of stick art.
** Example
google search: Turtle sculpture: a lot of turtle sculptures.
Rutgers QuickSearch: keyword turtle, subject: sculpture.

Skimming can take a lot of time and energy. Find what you like and do more of that.
Don't be submissive to your sources. The source is not the god-expert of the research. 
* Rutgers resources.
There exists a spreadsheet of artists sorted by theme maintained by MGSA staff.
