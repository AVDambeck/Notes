* Fundementals.
** Complexity
The design will be repeated a ton of times. eg minimalism is good.
Remove as many details as possible without removing core aspects.
Comics are more forgiving to complexity. 3d animaion is also forgiving.
*** Charecter elements that make it difficult to animate
- Fabrics with paterns/embrodery.
- Lots of dangly hair, charms, etc.
- Complex tatoos.
- Complicated color pallet.
- Complicated in general.
** Sillhouette.
A good design will be readable with only a sillhouette.
Contrast different charecters in the cast.
Different body types, hair styles, clothing/fasion, etc.

Minimalism. 
** Pitfalls
- Overly complex
