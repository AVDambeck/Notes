* Headings.
Headings are indicated with asterisks. More asterisks lower headings.
M-RET to insert a new heading on the same level.
While the point is in a heading, use tab to cycle the level.
M-LEFT/RIGHT to change the heading level.
M-UP/DOWN to move the heading and contents.

** Visibility.
C-u TAB cycles visibility of the heading at the point. C-u C-u C-u TAB shows all headings after point.

*** Sparce Trees.
A sparce tree is one that contains only a few of the headings of the whole tree. C-c / is used to create a sparce tree based on certain criteria. For example, C-c / r searches regex. Searching 'query' will change visibility so that only those headings containing 'query' will be visible.

** Motion.
All of these start with C-c.
- C-c C-n: next heading.
- C-c C-p: previous heading.
- C-c C-f: forward to next same level heading.
- C-c C-b: backwards to previous same level heading.
- C-c C-u: up to a higher level heading.
  
** Header to buffer.
C-x n s to make the current subtree into a buffer.
C-x n w to escape.

* Modifying Headers.
** Todo.

- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2023-03-11 Sat 10:43]
*** DONE Test todo items.
Any heading becomes a todo item when it stats with 'TODO'
Use C-c C-t to rotate the todo state of the current heading. If desired, these states can be [[https://orgmode.org/guide/Hyperlinks.html][modified.]]
Use C-u C-c C-t to mark the item as done, add a timestamp, and a comment (optional). How this works can also be [[https://orgmode.org/guide/Progress-Logging.html][modified]].

*** TODO [#A] Make another todo item.
Todo items can have priority. A is the highest, B the default, and C the lowest. use C-c , to set the priority. 

*** TODO Multi-task item [1/3].
Insert [%] or [/] to make an item into a multi task item.
**** DONE One.
**** TODO Two [66%].
- [X] This also works with checkbox [[Lists.]]
- [-] Even in layers! [1/2]
  - [X] ooo.
  - [ ] ahh.
- [X] Check items with C-c C-c.
** Tags.
Headings can contain tags, surrounded by colons.
Tags are inherited. For example, "buy soap" below is also tagged shores and urgent. #+FILETAGS: can also be used to tage every heading in a file. 

*** Learn about tags                                                    :edu:
*** Clean my bathroom                                         :chores:urgent:
**** Buy soap                                                        :errand:
*** Clean dishes                                                     :chores:

*** Adding Tags. 
C-c C-q can add a tag, and offers completion of tags. C-c C-c in a headline also does the same.
The list of tags is gathered dynamically from the existing tags in the file, however tags can be added to org-tag-alist or by using #+TAGS:. When adding tags this way, a single hot key can be specified. ex #+TAGS: @work(w) will make C-c C-q w add work tag to the current heading.

** Properties.
Value pairs associated with an entry.
*** Book

** Time.
This is a time stamp: [2023-03-11 Sat]. Use pointy brackets to show them in the agenda, or square to not. Use two dashes between them to make a range: [2023-03-11 Sat]--[2023-03-13 Mon]. They can include times: [2023-03-11 Sat 12:23]. Even repeating intervals: [2023-03-11 Sat 12:00 +12]. [[https://orgmode.org/guide/Timestamps.html][More]].
A heading will be assigned the date with in it. 
*** Meet Grace for coffee.
<2023-03-15 Wed 15:30>
*** Inserting.
- C-c . :: Prompt for a date and insert the time stamp. If the point is in a time stamp, it will modify the existing timestamp instead. If used twice, it adds a time range.
- C-c ! :: like C-c . but uses an inactive time stamp (wont show in agenda).
- S-LEFT/RIGHT :: Change the date at point by one day.
- S-UP/DOWN :: Shift the date format around.
*** Deadlines.
DEADLINE: <2023-03-12 Sun>
Deadlines will show up in the agenda. Can be made repeatable.
*** Scheduling.
SCHEDULED: <2023-03-21 Tue>
Scheduled tasks show up in the agenda. Can be made repeatable.
*** Clocking.
For tracking time spent on particular items.
- C-c C-x C-i :: Starts the clock on the current item. If it doesn't have one yet, it adds a log book.
- C-c C-x C-o :: Stops the clock.
- C-c C-x C-q :: Cancel the current clock.
- C-c C-x C-j :: Jump to the headline of the currently clocked task. 

**** Some Task.
:LOGBOOK:
CLOCK: [2023-03-11 Sat 13:57]--[2023-03-11 Sat 14:05] =>  0:08
CLOCK: [2023-03-11 Sat 13:56]--[2023-03-11 Sat 13:56] =>  0:00

* Lists.
- Unordered list items start with - + or * as bullets.
- Ordered list items start with #. or #).
- Description lists uses '::' to separate the term from the description.

Use C-c - to cycle the bullets. 
Use TAB to fold items like headings. 
Use M-RET to insert a new item at the current level.
Use M-S-UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT to move and indent list items just like headings.
Use M-S-LEFT/RIGHT to move only the current item.
Use C-c C-c to check or uncheck the current item.

* Tables.
Org Mode does a lot of very smart spreadsheet stuff. Begin a table with pipes, and using TAB or RET it automatically makes, sizes, resizes, and extends the table for you. See Emacs Calc package to do spreadsheet math magic.
