* A Note To Parts I & II
** On Authorship
Frate Perdurabo writes in a very dense and occult manor that is hard to understand. I have read some of their other work and can confirm this.
Liber ABA is in a large portion the work of others, such as Soror Virakam.
Liber ABA us composed  of "disjointed fragments of [Perdurabo's] casual conversation."
Large portions were taken from Perdurabo's dictation, especially in the Villa Caldarazzo in Naples. See Editor's Introduction.
** What is part I?
"A crude outline sketch"
Introductory and entry level.
About mysticism.
** What is part II?
More advanced than part I.
Expects the reader to know the literature on the subject, and to take an intelligent view of it.
About magick.
** Belief
Frater Perdurabo asks that students doubt. They want independence and self-reliance. 
Belief drawn from a persuasive tongue or efficient sword are destructive and contrary to religious experience.
Do the work yourself before believing.
* Preliminary Remarks.
** Crisis of the new aeon.
It is full of sorrow.
Religions start crudely by offering immortality.
In the new aeon, people are asking to see the proof of immortality.
Institutions are falling apart as people demand the proof.
** Criticism of religion. 
Begin by doubting every statement.
Hunchback and the soldier, even doubt affirms doubt, etc.
Reject faith but accept the report. 
*** What does every religion agree on?
Not in dogma, it is too varied.
The existence of miracles, but there is no proof.
Not in doctrine, ethics, mythology or afterlife. 
** The influence of genius.
The common between Christ, Buddha and Mohamed, and also Moses, St. Paul
Each lived very different lives.
Each has a messy literature base.
All spent a great period of time alone, likely in a cave.
Upon their return, they work miracles, or turn over political order or reveal a new law or whatever.
Their returned acts are not founded in what they were doing in that period (e.i. sitting in a cave).
Buddha gives very detailed explanations. The short is that they mastered the secret force of the universe.
St. Paul is note specific. Christ gives no explanation.
Mohamed was visited by an angel who communicated things from God.
Moses "beheld God."
Circa 1870 this phenomenon is religious, circa 1920 it is spiritual, circa 1970 it will be named scientifically.
If it where epilepsy, or another ailment, this would only be an argument for cultivating epilepsy.
Trying to debase one tradition through morality, insanity, sedition, heresy, or other pejorative is not helpful.
Some did not understand what happened to them, others did not want to make the path clear. Frater Perdurabo wants to make the path exceptionally clear.
** The vision of the new path.
Based of the system of the Buddha. But also with the considerations of the inputs of the followers of the other Masters.
They recommend "Virtues": Solitude, absence of excitement, moderation in diet, prayer/meditation.
The former are all in service to the last.
*** What is prayer/meditation?
Restraint of mind to a single act, state, or thought.
Human minds, by nature, are generally wandering and unfocused.
Intellectuals are generally able to connect one thought to the next in a channel. Damming this channel does little.
There is a trend in animals, that the larger an animal is, the fewer and more decisive its movements are.
By freeing the mind from external influences, it obtains power to somewhat see the truth of things.
