This are my notes and essays, from books, school, etc. I'm becoming a very rigrous notetaker and gennerally an avid learner. I'm also communithy and output focused. Accordly I'm posting my notes. Take whatever value you can gleam :)

Posting my notes also makes me take cleaner notes, trying to go back and make them seem more comprehensible, fixing gramatical and spelling errors, etc.

If you have notes on any of the things I've taken notes on, I think it might be fun to trade notes. Even make a meta notes about notes about subject thing. Hmu. 

Todo and done are some journaling for some of the projects to develope awareness of how long these things take.
